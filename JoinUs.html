      <ul class="requirementsToJoin">
          <li>Try to stay Consistent and participate most meetings.</li>
          <li>Participate in Most of the tournaments</li>

      </ul>
      <h2>‚ôü Activities</h2>
      <p class="CaptionJoinUs">---There are many sorts of activities in this club. In general meetings, Students get to challenge an opponent on an 
        over-the-board game or online game. However some days there are different game plans. On lesson days, a specific 
        tactic or opening is used and thoroughly studied by the students. Duuring club tournaments, students participate in a 
        knockout bracket chess tournament with prizes for the winners. During challenges, a powerful player is picked and must 
        play against all participating students to see how many games they can win simultaneously.
        <br><br>
        ---In "Varients" Chess, students either do a small tournament or a match but instead of normal Chess, a varient is played 
        (eg. 4 Player, Atomic, Duck, 960, Crazyhouse, etc). There are some days where students don't play. In cases where
         a student is going to a national or an international tournament, there would be a field trip hand picked to allow students to go 
         to support the accepted student. There are also free yearly field trips in which students go and meet famous grandmasters
          to get advice.
          <br> <br>---Finally, there are guest visit days when titled masters communicate or teach students about chess either 
          in-person or through Zoom. These are the hardest ones to coordinate.<br> Our leaders have worked hard to all of
           make this possible. So take part in all of it and have fun.</p>
